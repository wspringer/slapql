# README

Takes a WASM component and slaps a GraphQL interface on top of it.

```bash
slapql <FILENAME>
```

Note that this is just a proof of concept: it shows how you can use the metadata
embedded in a WASM component to build a GraphQL API. It's not guaranteed to work
for any WASM component. It may work for some.
